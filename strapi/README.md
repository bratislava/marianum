## Setup

Before you start, install all dependencies and create `.env.local` file which is .gitignored and used for local dev.

```
yarn
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You need postgres running locally (with correct credentials & database available). The easiest way to get a postgres db with the right credentials up&running is via `docker-compose.yml` file. Check the readme in the root of this repo.

## Build

Build your admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-build)

```
yarn build
```

## Start development server

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-develop)

```
yarn dev
```

## Start server

Start your Strapi application with autoReload disabled (not needed for development). [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-start)

```
yarn start
```

## Set permissions

To allow graphql queries, you need to give access to Public role:

Open Strapi admin panel, go to Settings > USERS & PERMISSIONS PLUGIN > Roles > Public. Check `find` and `findOne` for all content types.

## Load Navigation plugin config

You also need to load configuration for Navigation plugin:

In admin panel, go to Settings > NAVIGATION PLUGIN > Configuration, scroll down and press 'Restore configuration'. Then scroll up and press 'Restart Strapi'.

## Change Navigation plugin config

To add more content types to choose from in navigation, update config for navigation plugin in `/src/config/plugin.ts`. Don't forget to update graphql fragments and queries and generate types (see readme in `next` folder).

## Patch of `strapi-plugin-react-editorjs` plugin

The Editor.js plugin contains a huge set of plugins that cannot be deactivated by configuration. The authors of the plugin recommends to [copy the plugin into our respository](https://github.com/melishev/strapi-plugin-react-editorjs/blob/0451ecca84f569539538e40737045ee865a888b2/README.md#%EF%B8%8F-how-to-extenddevelop-this-plugin-optional) which is also below optimal. Therefore, the plugins are deactivated with stable and popular (1M+ weekly downloads) [`patch-package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package) tool. The patch is located in `patches` directory.
